# Security Policy

This document outlines how to report vulnerabilities. Td is a personal open-source project maintained in free time, without funding for security bounties or rewards.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Td, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email your findings to td+security@thelazysre.com or use GitHub's private security vulnerability reporting feature
3. Include:
   - A brief description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response:** You'll receive an acknowledgment within 72 hours
- **Updates:** We'll keep you informed about the progress every 7 days
- **Resolution:** Once resolved, we'll notify you

While we deeply appreciate security reports, please note that as a personal project, we cannot offer monetary compensation or bounties for vulnerability reports.

### After Submission

- If accepted: We'll work on a fix and coordinate the release with you
- If declined: We'll explain why and work with you if clarification is needed

## Best Practices

- Keep your dependencies up to date
- Use the latest stable version of Td
- Follow security best practices in your implementation
- Enable GitHub's automated security updates

Thank you for helping keep Td and its community secure! ðŸ”’
